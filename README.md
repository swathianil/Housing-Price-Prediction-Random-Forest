# Housing Prices Competition: Ames Housing dataset

This is a tutorial for beginners to work through the Housing Prices Cometition for Kaggle Learn Users [Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/)

Here is a short problem description:
"With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."
The task is to predict the selling price of a home based on a dataset describing exisiting homes, and their features and the final price.

In this kernel, we will work through the kaggle dataset Ames Housing to understand basic concepts of a Random forest Regressor.

## Objective

Predict the selling price of a home based on a dataset describing exisiting homes, and their features and the final price
