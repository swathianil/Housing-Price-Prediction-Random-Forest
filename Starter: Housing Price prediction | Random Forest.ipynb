It uses the ensemble learning method, which is a technique that combines predictions from several machine learning algorithms to make a predition, enabling it t make more accurate predtions than a single model.\n","\n","    - For this, a Random Forest constructs several decision trees during model training, and uses the result from all these trees togenerate a strong prediction. This is a very powerful method, however with a caveat. Overfitting can easily occur in a Random Forest model. It is advantageos to test outputs from several values of tree depth to determine the optimal tree depth. Mean absolute error is a useful metric to do this. \n","\n","![alt text for screen readers](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/rand-forest-2.jpg \"Credits: kdnuggets.com\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"71899ebc","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015701,"end_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:24.086766","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:24.071065","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a id='9'></a>\n","<span style=\"color:pink;font-weight:600;font-size:25px;font-style:serif\">\n","    Random Forest Regressor\n","</span>\n","\n","[Top](#21)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"id":"3cfca1c1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-17T09:07:24.120969Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-17T09:07:24.120299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-17T09:07:26.16251Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-17T09:07:26.161262Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.062258,"end_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:26.165035","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:24.102777","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0)"]},"execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Define a random forest model\n","rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0)\n","rf_model.fit(X_train_encoded_scaled, y_train)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"303f047b","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01571,"end_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:26.19688","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-10-17T09:07:26.18117","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a id='10'></a>\n","<span style=\"color:pink;font-weight:600;font-size:20px;font-style:serif\">\n","    Performance evaluation\n","</span>\n","\n","<span style=\"color:grey;font-weight:500;font-size:20px;font-style:serif\">\n","    Now that we have our model, it is important to do a basic evaluation, to see how our model is performing.
